Given a weighted undirected graph, provide the cost of a minimum spanning tree.

Input:
In the first line, two integers 𝑛 (1 <= n <= 10,000) and 𝑚 (1 <= m <= 200,000) are given where 𝑛
and 𝑚 are the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively. The following lines describes
𝑚 edges in a format of “𝑎 𝑏 𝑐” indicating that the graph has an edge between vertices 𝑎 and 𝑏 with
cost of 𝑐 . Note that the vertex index begins with 1 and the cost 𝑐 can be negative but |𝑐| <=
1,000,000.

Output:
You are required to output the cost of a minimum spanning tree.
